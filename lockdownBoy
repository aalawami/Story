[Intro]
"How long has it been?" the boy asked himself after standing up from his desk heading to kitchen. The boy opend his fridge to get something to eat only
to realize he was low on food. "I guess I have no choice but to go to the grocery shop" the boy sighed to himself. It has been a few months since the lockdown
started and the streets became silent. The boy headed back to his room to get changed and ready to head out into the outside world for the first time since this
whole mess started. "I've heard a lot op people complainig about this whole lockdown and being alone... seems I'm the only one who's life hasn't been impacted that
much" the boy said to himself. "Not sure what to make of this honestly" he thought to himself "being in lockdown has been very easy and I don't feel alone... I 
feel normal. Is something wrong with me? have I just gotten so lonely that it became my normal?". The boy wore his mask and left his apartment trying to shake 
these thoughts from his head "nah, I have people to go to if I ever needed them so I can't be lonely, right?" he thought as he crossed the road.
